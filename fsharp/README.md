Namespaces That Are Open by Default
Some namespaces are so frequently used in F# code that they are opened implicitly without the need of an explicit import declaration. The following table shows the namespaces that are open by default.

- FSharp.Core - Contains basic F# type definitions for built-in types such as int and float.
- FSharp.Core.Operators Contains basic arithmetic operations such as + and \*.
- FSharp.Collections Contains immutable collection classes such as List and Array.
- FSharp.Control Contains types for control constructs such as lazy evaluation and async expressions.
- FSharp.Text Contains functions for formatted IO, such as the printf function.
